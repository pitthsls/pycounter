# Changelog

## 3.0.0 (unreleased)

* COUNTER 3 support removed (was at EOL in 2014).
* CounterReport no longer has .year attribute (doesn't make sense for part or multi
year reports, and wasn't on COUNTER 5 reports in pycounter 2.0)
* Dropped support for python 2 and 3.5. Now supports only python 3.6+
* Add pycounter.report.CounterReport.from_xml() constructor.

## 2.1.4 (2020-07-08)
* Better handling of report JR2 [Stepan Henek]

## 2.1.2 (2010-01-24)
* fix a missed place with too-strict date handling

## 2.1.1 (2020-01-24)
* less strict date handling in Begin/End date strings to allow working with
badly-formatted reports that exist in the wild.

## 2.1.0 (2019-11-06)
* add support for COUNTER 4 title-level turnaways reports (JR2 and BR3).

## 2.0.0 (2019-09-13)

* COUNTER 5 support (still a work in progress; see README).
* Drops support for python 3.4, which is at its end of life.
* Deprecates parsing of COUNTER 3 reports (which should not have been issued after
January 2014)

## 1.1.1 (2019-03-01)

### Bugfixes
* SUSHI: Deal with missing institutional identifier for customer. [Geoffrey Spear]

  (see Issue #72. This should catch the exception involved in the
  issue, but there may be a wider issue with the Gale report since
  the &quot;customer&quot; object involved should not be None if there's
  an actual report to read, since the report itself is in the
  Customer XML element.)


### Code quality/CI

* Add pre-commit black hook, format all code with black. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Python 3.7 support. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Replace arrow library with pendulum. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Pyup: try updating all deps. [Geoffrey Spear]


## 1.1.0 (2018-08-03)

### Other

* SUSHI: Verify SSL certs by default. [Geoffrey Spear]

  (Bumps version to 1.1 because this could be a breaking change for
  sites that rely on requests to broken servers working without a flag)

  Fixes #67

* Don't try to do string formatting on given output file name. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Fixes #58


## 1.0.3 (2018-08-01)

### Bugfixes

* Negate bash regex match correctly. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Issue #63

* Retry SUSHI reports if &quot;Report Queued&quot; message is returned. [Geoffrey Spear]

  (This is kind of an ugly hack that looks for this string in the
  raw XML. A nicer fix will be possible with a fix for #3 )

### Docs
* Help for sushiclient --nodelay option (which probably shouldn't actually be used, but was helpful for testing without making the rest suite wait 60 seconds) [Geoffrey Spear]


### Code quality/CI

* Exclude builds for flake8/lint/manifest? [Geoffrey Spear]
  Issue #63
  
* Only use pylint version 1. [Geoffrey Spear]

  (version 2 drops py2 support)


## 1.0.2 (2018-05-11)

### Bugfixes
* Fix incorrect first_date_col for DB1 reports. [James Fournie]

  The first date column in a DB1 report should actually have index 5 (6th column).  See: https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-sections/usage-reports/#databases

### Tests

* Use universal wheel. [Geoffrey Spear]

## 1.0.0

* Dropped support for python 2.6 and 3.3

## 0.16

### CounterBook

given in a tabular report (or the constructor, manually), if any, or to an 
Online_ISBN or Print_ISBN given in an XML report, if they exist, in that 
order. CounterBook.online_isbn and CounterBook_print_isbn added. [Geoffrey 
Spear]

## 0.15.3

### Other

* Bump version for dev; enable branch coverage measurement, switch to pytest as test runner on travis. [Geoffrey Spear]


## 0.14.0 (2016-05-18)

### Other

* Wiley seems to be finicky about capitalization of at least the ID attibrute here... following SUSHIStarters' practice and sending with capitals. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Merge pull request #38 from withnale/provide_exceptions. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Provide context when sushi exception is generated

* Provide context when sushi exception is generated. [Paul Rhodes]

* Merge pull request #40 from withnale/report_type_support. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Added definitions to JR2,JR3,BR3 counter types

* Added definitions to JR2,JR3,BR3 counter types. [Paul Rhodes]

* Merge pull request #39 from withnale/avoid_none_column_errors. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Ensure that the encode method doesn't fail if the cell value is None

* Ensure encode does not fail when cell value is None. [Paul Rhodes]

* Update RTD link for their new domain. [Geoffrey Spear]

* BR2: get section type from the report, instead of hardcoding &quot;Chapter&quot; on output... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Merge pull request #33 from chill17/dbsushicodequality. [Geoffrey Spear]

  DB Sushi Code Quality

* Removed assertIn in tests for 2.6 compatability. [Ed Hill]

* Change sushi.py to work with DB_METRIC_MAP and configured tests for new output. [Ed Hill]

* Use DB_METRIC_MAP to map metric names from SUSHI to be consistent with the API. [Ed Hill]

* Make ensure_required_metrics work with METRICS and move sort out of method. [Ed Hill]

* Removed hardcoded DB metrics from report.py. [Ed Hill]

* Moved DB1 and DB2 metrics and mapping to constants.py. [Ed Hill]

* Document write_to_file and don't redefine format() builtin accidentally... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Flake8: missing whitespace. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Bump version, eliminate pylint unused variables complaints, prepare for more export formats. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Add module docstrings to the test suite. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Merge pull request #31 from chill17/addingdbtosushi. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Add DB1 and DB2 report processing to SUSHI

* Replace set comprehension with generator expression for Py2.6. [Ed Hill]

* Fixed pyflakes formatting issues. [Ed Hill]

* Variable names more explicit and set() call removed from loop. [Ed Hill]

* Added tests and data files for DB reports through SUSHI. [Ed Hill]

  TestConvertRawDatabase tests that all information is
  correct and in the correct order for a DB report.
  Utilizes sushi_simple_db1.xml which is in part based
  on formatting from ProQuest SUSHI reports

  TestRawDatabaseWithMissingData tests that, on output,
  SUSHI data is correct and full even if zero-value fields
  were not sent. January is missing data and there are no
  records for 'record_view' in the data source. Utilizes
  sushi_db1_missing_record_view.xml which is in part based
  on formatting from EBSCO SUSHI reports.

* Add method to CounterReport to insert missing metrics. [Ed Hill]

  SUSHI protocol does not guarantee fields with zero use
  are in a report. If a field has no use for a given
  period, it might not show up in the report at all.

  If a report is a datbase report, check each database
  to ensure it has all metrics and insert them with a 0
  for the first month of the reporting period. After all
  metrics have been established, sort them so they write
  to file in the correct order (sort order will be
  maintained after the subsequent title sort)

* Add method to CounterEresource to fill empty months. [Ed Hill]

  SUSHI protocol does not require transmission of
  fields with zero use. Ensures months with no data
  are inserted with a 0, then sorted. Calls from
  CounterDatabase.as_generic to accurately write as a
  COUNTER compliant report.

* Convert SUSHI metric codes to COUNTER metric names. [Ed Hill]

  Provide a mapping from SUSHI codes to COUNTER names
  for DB reports. If parsing a pre-formatted COUNTER
  report, it will fall back to whatever is already in
  the report.

* Added support for DB reports to be collected through SUSHI. [Ed Hill]

  DB reports are different because they have multiple metrics
  on multiple lines, and SUSHI protocol provides limited
  guarantees on how they will be formatted. Catch month values
  in a dict with metrics as keys, then send each as a
  CounterDatabase object

* Fix documentation a bit. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Giving up on pypy3 ever working (they're still using python 3.2, which we don't support anyway); removing expected failures since 3.6 is working now. [Geoffrey Spear]


## 0.13.0 (2016-04-05)

* Add &quot;created&quot; attribute to ReportRequest. Fix #30. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Suppress logging and warning output in unit tests... These are expected and there's no point in outputting them... [Geoffrey Spear]


## 0.12.0 (2016-03-17)

### Other

* Bump version for release. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Set title and platform attributes on CounterResource even if they're blank... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Order output reports by title. Fix #28. [Geoffrey Spear]

  (Also correct missing line at EOF in last commit)

* Add a test of bad content in CSV, not just Excel (which does more magic conversion behind the scenes before it even hits our code...) [Geoffrey Spear]

* Style/refactor: rename some locals, adjust some docs, to make pycharm inspections happier... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Travis: wrong YAML syntax... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Travis: print coverage report into log (coveralls being down shouldn't make it impossible to view coverage on the web...) [Geoffrey Spear]

* Py2: checking for int objects isn't enough in py2, since these get converted as longs. Use six. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Be more accepting of Excel dates formatted as dates (instead of COUNTER-mandated date format strings), Weirdly formatted date strings, commas in data. [Geoffrey Spear]

  ( issue #15 )

* Fix typo in docstring. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Some tiny reformatting. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Update copyright dates. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Warning when fallback encoding is used... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Bump version since the API is changing with encoding stuff... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Merge pull request #27 from chill17/publisher-fix. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Removed if condition for setting self.publisher from CounterEresource

* Removed if condition for setting self.publisher from CounterEresource class. [Ed Hill]

  ItemPublisher is listed in schema with minOccurs=&quot;0&quot;
  Not required for every field for valid Counter report
  When if condition fails and self.publisher is not set various methods
  such as CounterReport.write_tsv throw AttributeError exceptions because
  they assume self.publisher.
  Causes failure of writing and reading reports from some Counter compliant
  vendors.

* Update README to reflect that not only JR is supported by write_tsv (all report types supported for parsing can be output now); bump version for release. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Coverage: have a new file with 2-digit years since we dropped coverage by insisting BR2 did parse-export roundtrip correctly. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Add support for BR2 output. Fix #9. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Py2.6: no set literal syntax; just use a tuple, it's not slower for such a small test. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Add support for output of DB reports (DB1, DB2); fix some style issues. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Coverage: test file with multiple publishers and platforms (should bring us to 100% coverage) [Geoffrey Spear]

* Coverage: remove ISSNs from 1 SUSHI file to cover bit that deals with missing ISSNs. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Coverage: test creation of blank CounterJournal item. [Geoffrey Spear]

* If all publications have the same publisher, include the publisher name in the totals line. fix #23. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Use correct format for Platform report, even if it's bogus... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Pull report types for regex from constant instead of hardcoding. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Test valid but unsupported report type (Platform Report) [Geoffrey Spear]

* Remove some dead code; no idea if this actually ever did anything. [Geoffrey Spear]

* (coverage): don't cover line asserting it's unreachable. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Test unknown file type raises exception.

* (coverage): check that extra blank lines at the end of a file doesn't trip up the parser. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Change some __str__ methods to __repr__ and skip checking coverage for them... [Geoffrey Spear]

* Flake8: missed newline at end of file :( [Geoffrey Spear]

* Add support for output of report BR1. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Move hardcoded header column cells to a constant. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Document missing sushiclient options; a bit more code quality stuff. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Tweak BR1 SUSHI response a bit to make it more book-like and for code coverage. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Test SUSHI for book reports (The report could... use some work. Just based it off the JR1 report, and it's probably largely invalid but the parser doesn't care) [Geoffrey Spear]

* More tests for the SUSHI client. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Python 2.6 doesn't have assertIn; skip coverage check for __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; guard. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Add a simple test of the SUSHI client. [Geoffrey Spear]


## 0.10.1 (2015-12-04)

### Other

* Bump dev version number; move a private function to a public helper instead. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Flake8: some whitespace issues introduced in refactor. [Geoffrey Spear]

  use single branch; having sushiclient branch is becoming annoying.

* Module still not on sys.path. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Need to modify sys.path before the import for version, not after... (Doc build was failing on RTD without notifying me... should probably look into that...) [Geoffrey Spear]

* Use pep8 from pypi; nightly is an allowed failure now anyway. [Geoffrey Spear]

  Add an example to README for export to TSV

* CSV helper: use UNIX line endings by default; test writing TSV. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Fix spacing of COUNTER reports. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Reformat XML. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Include PDF and HTML totals from JR1 reports in data and output. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Flake8: missing blank line blows up Travis. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Flake8: missing blank line blows up Travis. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Add file type detection from contents of file, instead of only from filename.  Also add option to explicitly specify filetype. [Geoffrey Spear]

* Merge pull request #13 from pitthsls/issue1. [Geoffrey Spear]

  pull in fix for issue 1 (closes issue #1 )

* Pass tuples of date and usage into CounterJournal constructor from SUSHI; fixes issue #1 (still kludgy, since still involves passing bogus COUNTER 3 line into constructor to get title, publisher, etc.) [Geoffrey Spear]

* Bump version number. [Geoffrey Spear]

* (dropped alpha from version number) [Geoffrey Spear]


## 0.5 (2015-04-17)

* Make docs badge go back to project page, add regular link to documentation. [Geoffrey Spear]
